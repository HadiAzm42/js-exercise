// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

// let car = 'subaru';
// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
// console.log(car == 'subaru')
// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

let car = 'subaru';

// Evalute the car to true when checked.
console.log('"car === \'subaru\'"will be checked and be evaluate to true');
console.log(car === 'subaru');

// checks if there is any letter s in the variable.
console.log('"car.includes(\'s\')" checks letter s and will evaluate to true');
console.log(car.includes('s'));
